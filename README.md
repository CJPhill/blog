# A Blog Starter App

Written by: Clifford Phillips

This is a trivial blog app, started with create-react-app.

It works entirely within memory, so reloads blow everything away except for the first two mock articles.

App is used to grab and display articles with article.js and ArticleEntry.js and helps
with buttons to help with interaction

basic css done within App.css

authService.js helps to provide authentication from Firebase
This also provides welcoming users based on their google display name as well as their linked profile picture


ArticleService helps store articles based on title, body, date
